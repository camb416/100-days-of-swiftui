# 100 Days of SwiftUI

I've started doing [Paul Hudson](https://x.com/twostraws)'s [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). I'd like to improve my RealityKit and Unity/Native iOS interoperability skills to make high-fidelity 3D experiences that live and feel like first-class citizens in the Apple ecosystem.

## Day One: Avoiding Xcode
Days one and two are basic data types and printing. Watched the videos on 2x and making my life harder by testing the cross-platform nature of Swift.
- Installed Jetbrains toolbox on Ubuntu, which required a system update and some effort to install something called FUSE. This borked my video card driver. Cool.
- Installed Swift 6.0.1, which requires Python and Clang.
- Created a [run configuration](.fleet/run.json) in Fleet so I could run with Ctrl-R (no debugger support yet though)
- Did [the first checkpoint excercise](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/beginners/checkpoint-1) where you convert celsius to fahrenheit. Results [here](checkpoint-1.swift).

Takeaways:
- `let` meaning const instead of local `var` is weird, but I get it
- lots of helper methods on basic types
- emoji support is pretty funny, but shouldn't be in 2024
- Avoiding Xcode is hard mode, avoiding VSCode is **Hurt Me Plenty**
