# Starting SwiftUI

## Day 16

The videos aren't holding my attention, I'm not sure why. Something about it's making me completely space out. Maybe because it's pragmatic. I might just start skipping around.

put `@State private` in front of a var in a SwiftUI struct to make 'em mutable. Dunno why yet, just do it!

The `$` preceding a variable name indicates *two way binding* (variable can be read and written from a Text Field for example.)

`ForEach(0..<100){` lets you create views with a loop. It passes a closure and the syntax hurts my head just a little.
