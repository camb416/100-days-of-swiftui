# Starting SwiftUI

The videos aren't holding my attention, I'm not sure why. Something about it's making me completely space out. Maybe because it's pragmatic. I might just start skipping around.

put `@State private` in front of a var in a SwiftUI struct to make 'em mutable. Dunno why yet, just do it!
